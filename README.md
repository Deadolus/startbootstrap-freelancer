# [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)

This is a port of the [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)-theme to a heroku ruby on rails app.
I changed everything that is necessary (adding ActionMailer instead of PHP script, changing css, moving to gems, etc...) - it looks and feels very close to the original now. 
If you have any suggestions please comment, create a Issue or fork request (I am a not very experienced in Rails and may have added too much/not grasped some concepts).
I have a Mailtrap plugin in my heroku app, this is used in test and production environment in the rails app (and you might want to change it!). 
For the Mailtrap plugin to work you'll have to add those ENV-variables with their proper values in heroku:
* MAILTRAP_DOMAIN
* MAILTRAP_PASSWORD
* MAILTRAP_PORT
* MAILTRAP_USER_NAME
* MAILTRAP_ADDRESS


I already begun changing the Freelancer theme and there is some stuff in there from me - you may change that to your liking.
I am open to reintegrate the default theme in the future.

Freelancer is *"a one page freelancer portfolio theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This theme features several content sections, a responsive portfolio grid with hover effects, full page portfolio item modals, and a working PHP contact form."*
